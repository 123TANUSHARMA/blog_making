Content:
Social media has become an integral part of our lives, offering both benefits and challenges. While it connects us with others and provides a platform for self-expression, it can also negatively impact mental health. Constant exposure to curated images and posts can lead to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. It's important to use social media mindfully, setting boundaries and taking breaks when needed. Engage with positive content and seek support from real-life connections. By balancing online interactions with offline activities, you can maintain a healthy relationship with social media.</p>
